All chatbots come under the NLP (Natural Language Processing) concepts. NLP is composed of two things:

NLU (Natural Language Understanding): The ability of machines to understand human language like English.

NLG (Natural Language Generation): The ability of a machine to generate text similar to human written sentences.

Imagine a user asking a question to a chatbot: “Hey, what’s on the news today?”

The chatbot will break down the user sentence into two things: intent and an entity. The intent for this sentence could be get_news as it refers to an action the user wants to perform. The entity tells specific details about the intent, so "today" will be the entity. So this way, a machine learning model is used to recognize the intents and entities of the chat.



Train_chatbot.py — In this file, we will build and train the deep learning model that can classify and identify what the user is asking to the bot.

Gui_Chatbot.py — This file is where we will build a graphical user interface to chat with our trained chatbot.

Intents.json — The intents file has all the data that we will use to train the model. It contains a collection of tags with their corresponding patterns and responses.

Chatbot_model.h5 — This is a hierarchical data format file in which we have stored the weights and the architecture of our trained model.

Classes.pkl — The pickle file can be used to store all the tag names to classify when we are predicting the message.

Words.pkl — The words.pkl pickle file contains all the unique words that are the vocabulary of our model.
